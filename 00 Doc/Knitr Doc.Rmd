CS 329E Data Visualization - DV_TableauProject2
===

**For this project, we use in-depth government census data that focuses on student obesity/overweight rates from elementary to high schools within New York. We utilize SQL commands such as Partition By and rank() in order to display crosstabs in R which match crosstabs made from the same data in Tableau**

##Importing data frames:

We begin by importing some useful libraries:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
source("../01 SQL Crosstabs/lib.R", echo=TRUE, max.deparse.length=1e3)
```

##Rank

**Our first crosstab ranks the regions across New York which have the highest obesity rates. We make sure to group these regions by each grade level, and then by region, to keep the rankings separate using the PARTITION function in SQL.**

####SQL:
```{r}
source("../01 SQL Crosstabs/rank.R", echo=TRUE, max.deparse.length=1e3)
```
####Tableau:

##Difference

**The next crosstab involves making a column with the maximum obesity counts for each grade level, and then computing a difference between this maximum count and the current obesity count. The data is partitioned by grade level and region.**

####SQL:
```
SQL query for difference table would have been here.
```
####Tableau:

##Nth

**Our next crosstab displays the nth highest rate of obesity in a region given a grade level. In Tableau the nth slider bar allows the user to choose which tier of statistic he or she wants to see. The figure below shows the 2nd highest (n=2) obesity rate for each grade level.**

####SQL:
```
SQL query for Nth table would have been here.
```
####Tableau:

##Percentile

**The last crosstab we reproduce involves displaying the cumulative distribution, or percentile, for each of the obesity counts across regions partitioned by grade level.**

####SQL:
```
SQL query for percentile table would have been here.
```
####Tableau:
